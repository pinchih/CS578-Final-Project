#What's this?
This is a final project for Software Architecture ( CSCI578 ) at University of Southern California. In this project, we designed and implemented a web-based tool that enables users to check if installed apps on their Android devices are exposed to any threats of Inter-Component Communication (ICC) attacks and users can see a visualized result of overall architecture of targeted apps and also the potential vulnerable paths among applications.

#Overall system architecture visualization example
![](/image/overall_system_architecture_example.gif)
The overall system architecture visulaization gives you glance of how your application and other applications that we chosen interact with each other in terms of ICC calls. You may mouse over the path info icon to see what components were interacting, or mouse over the node to see what user permissions are alloed for this application. If you would like to know the interaction among components within an application, just click the name of that app, it will open up another window and show you the result.

#Tools
- OverallArchitectureXMLConverter.py
  - This tool takes inputs of series of XML files generated by COVERT, gather information for the inter- and intra-ICC relationships and output them as a JSON file in a pre-defined format, which will later be used for overall architecture visualization.
- VulnerablePathXMLConverter.py
  - This tool takes inputs of series of XML files and look into the analysis XML files, gather information for vulnerable paths suggested by COVERT and output a JSON file in a pre-defined format, which will later be used by VulnerablePathDidFail.py.
- VulnerablePathDidFail.py
  - This tool takes inputs of series of XML files generated by DidFail. It looks into analysis results, gather the information about potential vulnerable paths and combine these information to the JSON file which generated by  VulnerablePathXMLConverter.py.

#Usage
Go to our [website](http://192.241.189.66/top.html), upload your applications, and see the analysis results.
