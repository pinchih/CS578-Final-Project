#What's this?
This is a final project for Software Architecture ( CSCI578 ) at University of Southern California. In this project, we designed and implemented a web-based tool that enables users to check if installed apps on their Android devices are exposed to any threats of Inter-Component Communication (ICC) attacks and users can see a visualized result of overall architecture of targeted apps and also the potential vulnerable paths among applications.
